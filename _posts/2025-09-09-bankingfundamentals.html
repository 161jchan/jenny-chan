<p>We think of banks as buildings with vaults, but their real job is far more interesting. They have 3 simple tasks: take deposits, give loans, and move money. But these simple jobs give them 3 massive powers in the economy: they implement policy, absorb risk, and fuel growth.</p>

<p>They’re our financial shock absorbers. They give us a safe place to park cash (beats burying it in your backyard) while letting us withdraw it anytime. This protects us from inflation and theft. And they drive growth by acting as matchmakers, connecting our savings to businesses that have good ideas and need loans to make them happen.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">The Magic Trick: Making Money Out of Nothing</h2>

<p>Here’s their wildest power: money creation. No, they don’t print it. They lend it into existence.</p>

<p>Imagine this:</p>
<p>   You deposit $1,000 at a bank.
   The reserve ratio is 10%, so the bank keeps $100 and lends $900 to a business.
   That business deposits the $900 at its bank.
   Now, you still see $1,000 in your account, and the business sees $900. Poof! $1,900 exists from an initial $1,000.</p>

<p>This cycle repeats. The math says the total money created can be up to 1 / Reserve Ratio. So with a 10% ratio, that initial $1,000 can theoretically become $10,000 in the broader economy. Mind blown.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading"> Walking the Tightrope: The Power of Leverage</h2>


<p>This whole system runs on leverage—using borrowed money to amplify returns. The leverage ratio (Equity/Assets) measures how risky a bank is. A high ratio is safe. A low ratio is risky but can supercharge profits.</p>

<p>Lehman Brothers in 2008 is the classic cautionary tale. They ran on extremely high leverage (very low equity). When their bets went bad, losses wiped out their tiny equity cushion instantly. Their liabilities crushed their assets, and they collapsed. High leverage is a game of multipliers: it multiplies gains, but it also multiplies losses.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading"> Bond World 101</h2>

<p>Banks live and die by interest rates, and that means understanding bonds.</p>

<b>The Golden Rule: </b>  
<p>Bond prices and market interest rates have an inverse relationship. When rates go up, new bonds pay more. So old bonds with lower rates become less attractive and their prices must fall until their yield matches the new ones.</p>

 <b>What’s the “True” Rate?</b>
<p>Market Yield (`r`) is the return investors truly demand for a bond's risk. Yield to Maturity (YTM) is the rate implied by the bond's current price. If YTM < `r`, the bond is overpriced.</p>

  <b>What Makes a Bond "Strong"?</b>
 <p>Bonds with short maturity and high coupon rates are more resistant to interest rate moves. You get your money back faster and get bigger cash flows sooner, so you care less about future rate changes.</p>

 <b>The Purest Signal: Spot Rates </b> 
    <p>This is the yield on a zero-coupon bond. It’s the true, noise-free cost of borrowing money for a specific period. String these together and you get the yield curve, the master chart for all lending rates that even hints at future economic expectations.</p>

<p>The fundamental formula for the <strong>present value (PV)</strong> of a bond is the sum of its discounted cash flows:</p>

$$
PV = \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{C}{(1 + r)^t} + \frac{F}{(1 + r)^n}
$$

<p>Where:<br>
\( C \) = Coupon payment<br>
\( F \) = Face value (par value)<br>
\( r \) = Discount rate (yield to maturity)<br>
\( n \) = Number of periods until maturity</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Credit Risk and Bond Pricing</h2>
<p>The total price of a bond is the summation of all future cash flows discounted back to present value. When a company goes bankrupt like Lehman, the interest rate sky rockets because they are not trustworthy, so then the bond's value decreases significantly because each coupon and the present value is discounted heavily.</p>

<p>Bond price is a function of (time to maturity, coupon rate, and discount rate). When coupon rate = discount rate (c=r), bond price equals par value. A discounted bond is when r > c or the bond is sold for less than its face value.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote"> A Quick Fun Fact (Convexity):</blockquote>
   If the market drops 5% and then rises 5%, you don't break even. You end up slightly down. Why? The math of percentages and the curved (convex) relationship between price and yield means the gain on the way up is applied to a smaller base than the loss on the way down.</p>


<h2 class="section-heading"> A Few Quick Jargon Bustes:</h2>

 <b>Callable Bond:</b> 
<p>The issuer’s "get out of jail free" card. If interest rates fall, they can call the bond back (repay you early) and then re-borrow at a cheaper rate. Great for them, annoying for you.</p>
  <b>Full Price:</b>
 <p>What you actually pay for a bond. It's the flat price plus Accrued Interest (AI)—the interest earned by the seller since the last coupon payment. AI is basically a fair charge for the time they held the bond but didn’t get a coupon.</p>

<p>Hopefully, this connects the dots! Banking is all about this interplay: using leverage to multiply the magic of money creation, all while constantly navigating the risks of the interest rate world.</p>

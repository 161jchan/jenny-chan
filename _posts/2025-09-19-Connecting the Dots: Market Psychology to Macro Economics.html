<h2 class="section-heading">Market News & Macroeconomics</h2>
<p>Right now, we're in a strange market. Everything—gold, silver, bitcoin, the S&P 500, real estate—seems to be at an all-time high. Is it a bubble? To check, we compare asset prices not to each other, but to the U.S. dollar using the DXY index. It appears the dollar is losing purchasing power. The M2 money supply is at all-time highs, growing 5-10% annually, and with the Fed expected to cut rates, this could lead to more inflation and spending. People are moving out of cash and into assets to protect their wealth.</p>

<p>Recently, we've seen rising consumer prices (CPI) but stable core CPI. Producer prices (PPI) dropped unexpectedly, suggesting inflationary pressures might ease. At the same time, the labor market is weakening. Normally, the Fed raises rates to fight inflation, but now they might cut them to support the economy, viewing the inflation spike as temporary.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Volatility and Modeling Behavior</h2>
<p>Daily market volatility is the standard deviation of returns. It has "fatter tails" than a normal distribution—extreme events happen more often than models predict. Models like EWMA and GARCH are used to estimate volatility, giving more weight to recent data. GARCH is especially smart because it incorporates a long-run average variance, meaning it expects volatility to eventually drift back to a steady state after a shock.</p>

<p>The challenge is modeling human behavior alongside big data. Risk managers look at the tails of the distribution (the worst-case scenarios), while traders often focus on the mean (the most likely outcome). This difference in perspective is crucial.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">The Power of the Subconscious Mind</h2>
<p>The subconscious mind is incredibly powerful. It controls heart rate, temperature, and adrenaline—it can unlock abilities beyond logic. But it's also impressionable. If you consciously accept something as true (even if it's false, like "I'll never be able to afford that"), your subconscious will accept it as truth and filter your reality to find supporting evidence. This is called reticular activating.</p>

<p>The key is to be careful what you say and think. Simplify what you want to impress upon your subconscious and repeat it, especially right before bed and when you wake up. Don't dwell on obstacles. You can choose your reactions, surround yourself with positive people, and reject negativity. Train your subconscious to recognize opportunity, not block it with limiting beliefs.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Credit Risk and Bond Pricing</h2>
<p>The total price of a bond is the summation of all future cash flows discounted back to present value. When a company goes bankrupt like Lehman, the interest rate sky rockets because they are not trustworthy, so then the bond's value decreases significantly because each coupon and the present value is discounted heavily.</p>

<p>Bond price is a function of (time to maturity, coupon rate, and discount rate). When coupon rate = discount rate (c=r), bond price equals par value. A discounted bond is when r > c or the bond is sold for less than its face value.</p>

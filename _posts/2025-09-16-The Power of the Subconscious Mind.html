<h2 class="section-heading">The Power of the Subconscious Mind</h2>
<p>The subconscious mind is incredibly powerful. It controls heart rate, temperature, and adrenalineâ€”it can unlock abilities beyond logic. But it's also impressionable. If you consciously accept something as true (even if it's false, like "I'll never be able to afford that"), your subconscious will accept it as truth and filter your reality to find supporting evidence. This is called reticular activating.</p>

<p>The key is to be careful what you say and think. Simplify what you want to impress upon your subconscious and repeat it, especially right before bed and when you wake up. Don't dwell on obstacles. You can choose your reactions, surround yourself with positive people, and reject negativity. Train your subconscious to recognize opportunity, not block it with limiting beliefs.</p>

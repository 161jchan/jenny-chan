<p>Right now, we're in a strange market. Everything—gold, silver, bitcoin, the S&P 500, real estate—seems to be at an all-time high. Is it a bubble? To check, we compare asset prices not to each other, but to the U.S. dollar using the DXY index. It appears the dollar is losing purchasing power. The M2 money supply is at all-time highs, growing 5-10% annually, and with the Fed expected to cut rates, this could lead to more inflation and spending. People are moving out of cash and into assets to protect their wealth.</p>

<p>Recently, we've seen rising consumer prices (CPI) but stable core CPI. Producer prices (PPI) dropped unexpectedly, suggesting inflationary pressures might ease. At the same time, the labor market is weakening. Normally, the Fed raises rates to fight inflation, but now they might cut them to support the economy, viewing the inflation spike as temporary.</p>
